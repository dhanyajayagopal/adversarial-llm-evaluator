# Adversarial LLM Evaluator

A multi-agent system I built to dynamically evaluate large language models through adversarial testing, defense analysis, and automated scoring.

## The Problem I Solved

Traditional LLM evaluation relies on static benchmarks that can't adapt or discover new vulnerabilities. I created a system where AI agents work together to generate tests, learn from failures, and provide comprehensive security analysis in real-time.

## How I Built It

I designed four specialized AI agents that coordinate with each other:

**Red Team Agent**: I implemented this to generate adversarial prompts and jailbreak attempts. It learns from previous attacks and creates increasingly sophisticated tests.

**Blue Team Agent**: I built this to analyze why attacks succeed or fail and recommend specific defense strategies. It identifies vulnerability patterns and suggests mitigations.

**Judge Agent**: I created this to objectively evaluate model responses across multiple dimensions - safety, bias, quality, and attack resistance.

**Coordinator Agent**: I designed this to orchestrate the entire evaluation process, managing multi-round campaigns and aggregating results.

## Technical Architecture

I implemented an asynchronous message-passing system where agents communicate through a central router. Each agent specializes in a specific aspect of evaluation, but they work together to provide comprehensive analysis.

The system I built supports:
- Dynamic attack generation that adapts based on success patterns
- Multi-round evaluations with learning between rounds
- Real-time coordination between multiple AI agents
- Comprehensive scoring across safety, bias, and quality metrics
- Automated defense analysis and recommendation generation
- Side-by-side model comparison and ranking

## What I Learned

Building this system taught me several important concepts:

**Multi-Agent Systems**: I learned how to design agents that communicate and coordinate effectively. Each agent has its own responsibilities but contributes to a larger goal.

**Adversarial AI**: I implemented red team vs blue team concepts from cybersecurity, applying them to AI safety. The red team tries to break the model while the blue team analyzes vulnerabilities.

**LLM Evaluation**: I went beyond static benchmarks to create dynamic testing that can discover new failure modes as they emerge.

**Async Programming**: I used Python's asyncio to handle concurrent agent operations and message passing efficiently.

**System Design**: I learned to design modular, extensible systems where new agents or evaluation methods can be easily added.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone <your-repo>
cd adversarial-llm-evaluator
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run individual agent tests
python examples/test_red_team.py
python examples/test_blue_team.py  
python examples/test_judge.py

# Run the complete multi-agent system
python examples/test_full_system.py
```

## Example Results

When I run the system, it produces comprehensive evaluation reports:

```
Aggregate Metrics:
   Attack Success Rate: 50.0%
   Security Score: 100/100
   Quality Score: 0.56
   Final Grade: C
   Total Attacks: 30

Recommendations:
   [CRITICAL] High Attack Success Rate
   Model has 50% attack success rate - immediate security review needed
```

## Code Examples

### Running a Full Evaluation

I designed the system to be easy to use programmatically:

```python
from agents.coordinator import CoordinatorAgent

coordinator = CoordinatorAgent("coordinator", {"model": "test"})
await coordinator.initialize_agents()

task = {
    "type": "full_evaluation",
    "target_model": "your_model",
    "config": {
        "rounds": 3,
        "attacks_per_round": 10,
        "attack_type": "safety"
    }
}

result = await coordinator.process_task(task)
```

### Targeted Vulnerability Testing

I also implemented focused testing for specific vulnerabilities:

```python
task = {
    "type": "targeted_evaluation", 
    "target_model": "your_model",
    "focus_areas": ["jailbreak", "bias_testing"],
    "attacks_per_area": 5
}
```

### Comparing Multiple Models

The system I built can evaluate multiple models side-by-side:

```python
task = {
    "type": "model_comparison",
    "models": ["model_a", "model_b", "model_c"],
    "config": {"rounds": 2, "attacks_per_round": 8}
}
```

## Technical Skills Demonstrated

Building this project required me to learn and implement:

**Multi-Agent Architecture**: I designed a system where multiple AI agents coordinate to solve complex problems.

**Adversarial Machine Learning**: I implemented attack generation and defense analysis techniques used in AI security research.

**Async Programming**: I used Python's asyncio extensively for concurrent operations and message passing.

**System Design**: I created a modular, extensible architecture that can be easily extended with new capabilities.

**AI Evaluation**: I developed comprehensive scoring systems for safety, bias, and quality assessment.

**Production Patterns**: I implemented proper error handling, logging, and testing throughout the system.

## Key Innovations

I made several design decisions that make this system unique:

**Adaptive Testing**: Unlike static benchmarks, my system learns from previous results and generates increasingly sophisticated attacks.

**Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: I evaluate models across multiple aspects simultaneously - safety, bias, quality, and robustness.

**Agent Specialization**: Each agent I designed has a specific expertise, mimicking how security teams actually work.

**Real-Time Coordination**: The agents communicate and coordinate in real-time, enabling dynamic evaluation campaigns.

## Educational Value

This project demonstrates several important computer science concepts:

**Distributed Systems**: Multiple agents working together with message passing
**Machine Learning**: Dynamic model evaluation and adaptation
**Software Architecture**: Clean, modular design with clear separation of concerns
**Cybersecurity**: Red team vs blue team methodologies applied to AI
**Concurrent Programming**: Efficient async operations and coordination

## Why This Matters

I built this system because current LLM evaluation has significant limitations. Static benchmarks can't discover new vulnerabilities or adapt to evolving threats. My multi-agent approach provides:

- Dynamic vulnerability discovery
- Adaptive attack generation
- Comprehensive security analysis
- Automated defense recommendations
- Scalable evaluation infrastructure

This addresses real needs in AI safety and security that companies working with large language models face every day.

## Future Enhancements

I designed the system to be extensible. Potential improvements include:

- Integration with real LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- Web dashboard for managing evaluation campaigns
- Advanced attack generation using reinforcement learning
- Integration with MLOps pipelines for continuous testing
- Support for multimodal models (vision, audio)

The modular architecture I created makes these enhancements straightforward to implement.
